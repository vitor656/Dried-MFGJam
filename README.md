This game was made for My First Game Jam: Summer 2018. It's a small narrative game where you just walk and read stuff. 
The optional theme was "Water", then I thought about creating a game about the absence of water. Although it takes place in 
some area known for this kind of problems, I kind of included some personal thougths and reflections.
